0. Preparations
* Create database from cars_colors.sql
* .headers on
* .nullvalue NULL
* .schema
* SELECT * FROM car;
* SELECT * FROM color;

1. Select license, color from car and color.

Suggestion?

We have to join the tables on color_id

* car natural join color - works
* car join color on car.color_id = color.color_id - works
* car join color using (color_id) - works

2. What colors doesn't any car have?
* What does the question mean?
** What colors have an id that no car has as color_id
* Suggestions?

* Why were only "car-colors" listed in example 1?
** Inner joins skip non-matched rows
* What about OUTER JOIN? SQLite supports LEFT OUTER JOIN
** LEFT OUTER JOIN keeps all rows of the left table:
** SELECT license, color FROM color LEFT OUTER JOIN car USING(color_id);
* So, what's the license value in rows with non-car-colors?
** NULL
* So, what if we filter using WHERE license IS NULL?
** SELECT color FROM color LEFT OUTER JOIN car USING(color_id) WHERE license IS NULL;

Lessons learned:
* INNER JOIN skips rows where the join-column is null (no match)
* LEFT OUTER JOIN keeps all rows from the left table (color in our case)
* NULL-check is done using "IS NULL"

3. SELF-JOINs
Prepare:
Create database from students.sql
.headers on
.schema
SELECT name FROM students;

4. What names have a unique initial letter?
* SELECT SUBSTR(name,1,1), name, student_id FROM students ORDER BY name;

Can you see which ones have a uniq initial letter?
* Chip, Goofy, Hewey, Louie, Pluto, Scrroge

* Let's print out the names, intials and the count of initials:
** SELECT name, SUBSTR(name, 1, 1) AS initial, COUNT(*) AS num FROM students GROUP BY initial;

* GROUP BY - needed for COUNT()

We can now restrict our result, using HAVING()
* What should we give as arguments to HAVING?
** SELECT name, SUBSTR(name, 1, 1) AS initial, COUNT(*) AS num FROM students GROUP BY initial HAVING num=1;

* List only name, but What should we GROUP BY and what should we restrict to?
** SELECT name FROM students GROUP BY SUBSTR(name, 1, 1) HAVING COUNT(SUBSTR(name, 1, 1)) = 1;

* Alternative solution, using sub-select:
SELECT name FROM (SELECT name, COUNT(SUBSTR(name, 1, 1)) AS num FROM students GROUP BY SUBSTR(name, 1, 1) HAVING num = 1);
