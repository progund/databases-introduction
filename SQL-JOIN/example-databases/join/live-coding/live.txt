0. Prepare:
Create database from exam_results_not_normalized.sql and show students.

Next, create database from both students.sql and exam_results.sql
.read students.sql
.read exam_results.sql

1. How do we list student name and exam results?
.schema students
.schema exam_results

* What columns should we JOIN ON?
** students.student_id and exam_results.student_id

* Using cartesian product and WHERE:
SELECT name, id_number, score FROM students, exam_results WHERE exam_results.student_id = students.student_id;

* Using NATURAL JOIN:
SELECT name, id_number, score FROM students NATURAL JOIN exam_results

* Using JOIN ON
SELECT name, id_number, score FROM students JOIN exam_results ON students.student_id = exam_results.student_id;

* Using JOIN USING():
SELECT name, id_number, score FROM students JOIN exam_results USING(student_id);
